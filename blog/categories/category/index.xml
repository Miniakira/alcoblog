      <description>Today I decided to get a domain for my own personal stuff and move everything &amp;ldquo;meme&amp;rdquo; to alcohomies.com. I moved everything from alcohomies to another droplet on Digital ocean I share with my friends.
I bought the domain holic.io just to make funny subdomain names like &amp;ldquo;fidgetspinner.holic.io&amp;rdquo; but in retrospect it was harder to make up some funnier names within this template than I thought. Oh well! It&amp;rsquo;s a short neat little domain at least.</description>

      <description>Hey!
Im a 28 year old guy that recently (1 month ago) started learning web development pretty much from scratch except for html/css. While I have previous programming experience, I feel like I have a lot to learn.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying out different languages and frameworks and I landed on the MERN stack as my final choice on what to learn. I really enjoy using only javascript and react was more like a flip of a coin after asking around and starting Angular vs React wars.</description>

      <description>This my first venture into the world of static site generators! and given the headaches it gave me until I found one that I liked, it might be a while until I go on another adventure.
Hopefully this all worked and you can now read the first post on my blog!</description>
