Hey!

Im a 28 year old guy that recently (1 month ago) started learning web development pretty much from scratch except for html/css. While I have previous programming experience, I feel like I have a lot to learn.

I've been trying out different languages and frameworks and I landed on the MERN stack as my final choice on what to learn. I really enjoy using only javascript and react was more like a flip of a coin after asking around and starting Angular vs React wars.

I bought a great book called [Fullstack React](https://www.fullstackreact.com/) and I am making great progress so far!

This blog will be used for me to log my progress in my webdev adventures. So stay tuned for some real nice salt when I get stuck!
